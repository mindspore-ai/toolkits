# DeepInsight-tool

DeepInsight is an intelligent tool to auto-analyze the profile of MindSpore LLM training. It is specially designed to provide professional deep analysis and insights on the training performance profiling data, so that any people can fast and easily optimize the training performance of any LLM models. The tool input is the profile file named "kernel_details.csv" and the IR graph files generated by MindSpore profiling tool. The tool output is the detailed analysis report that contains the specific portation of E2E time, which consists of cube computation time, FA computation time, vector computation time, and TP/DP/EP communication time, PP bubble time and free time. More detailed information that related to the performance optimization are also included such as the communication overlapping ratio, the cube mac utilization ratio and so on.
